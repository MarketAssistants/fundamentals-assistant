Pending: 
- I want to graph all these main fundamentals quantities these in a single graph some will have quarterly points and some will have yearly values
- convert to OOP - Module fashion
- get trailing eps (follow recursive method (check stock backlog album))
- Spike: look for ways to improve the histogram reward system (research on how to find deals just 
By looking at the position in the histogram). 


In Progress: 


Done: 
- get familiar with SEC API. 
- created generic methods to plot histograms. 
- get last quarter eps - plot histogram. 
- create quick reward system to measure "sepecial positioned" tickers in histogram. 
- move database to separate folder to be called by other classes.
